            <p>
                The Text Adventure project was assigned at the same time as this portfolio, thus inducing fear and paranoia. I chose my partner to be Icarus Wedekind for the project. It taught us how to balance multiple projects at the same time, and gave us more insight on how work would be like in the real world. During the whole development process, from coming up with the story to completing the code, we kept a DevLog and Task List to keep track of what we did and how we accomplished it. It also helped us quantify our problems, which made them easier to overcome. We also had to make a presentation on our entire process of development. After a lot of hard work, it was (probably) completed. As of writing this, it is not completed but is coming along well. If there is no link, it is because the Text Adventure was not completed.
