            <p>
                The Text Adventure project was assigned at the same time as this portfolio, thus inducing fear and
                paranoia. I chose my partner to be Icarus Wedekind for the project. It taught us how to balance multiple
                projects at the same time, and gave us more insight on how work would be like in the real world. During
                the whole development process, from coming up with the story to completing the code, we kept a DevLog
                and Task List to keep track of what we did and how we accomplished it. It also helped us quantify our
                problems, which made them easier to overcome. We also had to make a presentation on our entire process
                of development. After a lot of hard work, it was (probably) completed. As of writing this, it is not
                completed but is coming along well.
