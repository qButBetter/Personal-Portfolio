            <h1>EECU Budget Calculator</h1>

            <p>
                The EECU Budget Calculator website was not the best graphically, but it was the best functionally. A lot
                of the language in the whole project was JavaScript and HTML. The whole idea of the website was to make
                a budget calculator for the average user, while crunching the numbers and displaying what each part of
                your checkbook has. Most of the project in the beginning was done by having half of the class be
                “managers” and the other half be “workers”. The managers would have the workers build the project with
                their guidance. It would then flip-flop after the session was over. Although, a lot of what my workers
                did was scrapped in the final product, besides the overall structure of the HTML and CSS. I would say
                this project was a good way to learn what working for someone in the real world would be like. There
                were also some setbacks, such as needing to access the API of EECU, and not just a list. Overall rating,
                8/10. If you wish to see the calculator, visit it <a target="_blank"
