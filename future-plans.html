            <p>
                After I go to a Community College to get my required classes out of the way, I would go to a CSU, such
                as
                Fresno State, to get a degree in my field of expertise. I would also have a part-time job to have some
                spending money and also put some money in savings. I would still be living with my parents since housing
                prices. Once I get into a CSU, I would still work part-time and finish my studies at the CSU. Once I get
                my
                degree I would apply for jobs that link up with my profession.
