            <h1>Pickle's Prehistoric Bites</h1>

            <p>
                This website was one of the last websites I made as a CART Web Apps student. As you can tell, there's a
                lot
                of functionality compared to other, more earlier projects. I first had to choose what kind of
                “full-service”
                website we wanted to make and who we were working with. I then had to conduct a competitive audit to see
                what competitors did well, and what they could improve on. The overall purpose of this project was to
                give
                InGen, the company from Jurassic Park, a website for a multitude of attractions in their park. During
                development, there were a lot of issues. Namely, the navigation bar with the logo and the “hamburger”
                icon.
                They never seemed to fit just right and always had something wrong with their sizing or positioning.
                Another
                problem was some of the images not sizing up correctly and would appear pixelated. Although there were a
                lot
                of parts that I loved about the project, mainly the humor I felt when I was able to make an entire
                restaurant's website based on a running joke I made up. Another part would be the JavaScript needed to
                make
                an image carousel with some of the foods in the restaurant. Overall rating, 9/10
