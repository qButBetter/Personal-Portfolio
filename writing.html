                At CART, we also have an English class to make up for missing some core classes at my home school. In
                this English class, we have looked at numerous writings that correlate to the overall theme of the
                school year. This year being Jurassic Park. We first started with Ray Bradbury's writing and then read
                Jurassic Park. Afterwards, we had to write an essay on how Chaos Theory (a key part of Jurassic Park)
                was carried out in the book and how characters reacted to it. I do like how the prompt made us look
                deeper into the whole story, rather than just gawking and the idea of dinosaurs roaming the Earth. In
                our English class we also had to make a plan after high school about what we were going to do, and how
                we would do that. This also had us look at our lives through a lens not noticed before, and helped us
                understand that this is what real life is like. If you would like to view my essay, the link is provided

                Another writing prompt we had at CART was the Ready Player One essay. Obviously we had to read the book
                to understand the key points and themes of the book. We were given multiple prompts to choose from such
                as the prompt: "Should programmers around the world develop an Oasis-like public school system? Why or
                why not?". A crucial part of the book was when Wade, the main character, goes to school on a planet
                called Ludus in the OASIS. The story shows the ups and downs of online school using Virtual Reality. If
