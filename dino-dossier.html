            <h1>Dino Dossier: Spinosaurus</h1>

            <p>
                This was one of the first websites I made for a project at CART. It really shows graphically and
                informationally. I had to scour through a lot of websites claiming to have info on the Spinosaurus, only
                for it to be about some subspecies of it or just overall knowledge every other site used. A hard part of
                the website was introducing a “carousel” of images. It was difficult since the website was made in the
                first semester of CART and we learned JavaScript in the second semester. After going through countless
                websites, I was ready to compile all of the information into HTML. This project was good in the sense of
                what it felt like to make a website from scratch, and put gathered information there. I also had a lot
                of fun making the website since we didn't have to worry about looks or functionality. Overall rating,
                8.5/10.
