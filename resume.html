                        <i>Volunteering:</i>
                        <br>
                        Virtually every Sunday since December of 2022, I have volunteered at Valley Animal
                        Center (VAC). At the adoption center, I usually do odd-jobs, such as sweeping, changing
                        linens, and swapping out water and food. After 3 months, I decided to also volunteer at
                        their feral yard, which is outside. I would volunteer at the adoption center for an hour,
                        then go to the feral yard for 2 hours, since the outside wasn't maintained as much as the
                        inside. As of 2024, VAC is renovating the feral yard and allowing some of the outside cats
                        to be adopted due to the help I have given to keep the feral yard sustained.

                        <i>E-Sports Club Member:</i>
                        <br>
                        I wanted to join E-Sports club my freshman year of high school, but I didn't have the time
                        in my daily schedule to do so. I then decided my junior year to sign up at my school's
                        “Club Rush”. The club meets every Tuesday and Thursday, with Thursdays being our
                        tournament days to play against other schools. We also have extra-curricular activities on
                        some weekends. I have participated in most extra-curricular activities and tournaments
                        held by the school E-Sports club.

                        <i>CART Student:</i>
                        <br>
                        During my sophomore year of high school, I was recommended CART since I was
                        excelling in all of my home school classes. I decided to sign up for CART, but it was a
                        lottery system to get in, so everyone had the same chance to get in if they had signed up.
                        I enrolled in the Web Applications Lab since I had prior experience with HTML and CSS.
                        As of 2024 I have outstanding grades in my Lab and the connected English class. Next
                        year I will take the Interactive Game Design Lab to broaden my horizons of Web-based
                        programming and Game-based programming.
